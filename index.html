   <h2>My favourite anime</h2>
	<p>My favourite anime is Attack on Titan. As much as it is a well-written story, it is also overall kind of gruesome and violent.</p>
	   <br>
	<p> The overall story in Attack on Titan is also very historical. It is seen that the characters all have technology based on our technology back in the 1800's. They barely know what trains are and how those work. Only in the final season they know how to operate hot air balloons and trains. Within this specific universe it is very funny to see how they cope with technology and their discovery of the overall world they live in.
